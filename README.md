## Check out the website at: [MedInnovator.me](http://MedInnovator.me)
MedInnovator.me is a website dedicate toward inspiring others to pursue an interdisciplinary field that merges medicine and technology. It was inspired after facing difficulties in finding resources to develop software engineering competence for non-traditional tech enthusiasts. The website highlights my adventures in delving into the computer science world as a Biology major and the struggles that I have faced of disrupting the healthcare field.
