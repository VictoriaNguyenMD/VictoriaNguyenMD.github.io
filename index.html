		<p class="intro"> I'm a software engineer in the Bay Area. I graduated from UC Berkeley with a triple major in computer science, mathematics, and business administration in May 2019.

In the past, I've worked as a Modeling Engineering Intern at the hedge fund Two Sigma, as an Associate Consultant Intern at Bain & Company, and as a Software Engineering Intern at Google. Over the last few years, I've worked on a type system to statically enforce differential privacy, a highly-scalable serverless machine learning framework, and a platform to facilitate the meta-analysis of neuroimaging literature.
